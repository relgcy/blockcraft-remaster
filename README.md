# BlockCraft

BlockCraft is a WebGL implementation of an infinite procedurally-generated voxel world that runs on the browser. This project originally spawned as a Minecraft Classic clone but has expanded to include multiplayer PvP, crafting, shaders and much more!

Here's a [summary](https://victorwei.com/blog/blockcraft.pdf) of my development journey!

# BlockCraft in 2025

BlockCraft is not officially maintained by the developers anymore as its original repository was archived in December of 2022. I however would like to bring life to BlockCraft once more and I have updated the libraries BlockCraft uses and plan to at some point in the near future buy a domain along with cloud servers and host this update of BlockCraft online. Along with my ambitions of bringing back BlockCraft in other branches of this repository I also would like to create special variations of this game such as a World builder or a Pvp-Trainer.

## How to Run Locally

To run BlockCraft on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Start the Server:**
    * Open your terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to the server directory:
        ```bash
        cd server
        ```
    * Install the server dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * Start the server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    * Leave this terminal running.

2.  **Start the Client:**
    * Open a **new, separate** terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to the client directory:
        ```bash
        cd client
        ```
    * Install the client dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * Start the client:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```

The client should open in your default web browser.
