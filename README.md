# BlockCraft

BlockCraft is a WebGL implementation of an infinite procedurally-generated voxel world that runs on the browser. This project originally spawned as a Minecraft Classic clone but has expanded to include multiplayer PvP, crafting, shaders and much more!

Here's a [summary](https://victorwei.com/blog/blockcraft.pdf) of my development journey!

# BlockCraft in 2025

BlockCraft is not offically maintained by the developers anymore as its oringal repository was archived in December of 2022. I however would like to bring life to BlockCraft once more and I have updated the libaries BlockCraft uses and plan to at some point in the near future buy a domain along with cloud servers and host this update of BlockCraft online. Along with my ambitions of bringing back BlockCraft in other branches of this repository I also would like to create special varirations of this game such as a World bulder or a Pvp-Trainer.
